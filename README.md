# Impact of Social Vulnerability on COVID-19 Health Indicators in Puerto Rico

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted many communities globally, especially socially vulnerable communities. Years of Potential Life Lost (YPLL) has shown to be a useful indicator when measuring disparities because these have been occurring at younger ages when compared across race and ethnicity. The surge of the Delta variant further increases the importance of using YPLL to assess the impact of mortality in younger groups of people. The change in predominance from the Delta towards the Omicron variant also had an effect on the YPLL.
